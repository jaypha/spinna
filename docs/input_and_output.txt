
== Input and Output ==

Web servers take input in the form of a HTTP request and supplies output in the form of an
HTTP response. Spinna works with the request and response directly.

The jaypha.spinna.global module declares two variables, "request" and "response", of types
HttpRequest and HttpResponse respectively.

HttpRequest is defined in jaypha.spinna.request.
HttpResponse is defined in jaypha.spinna.response.

HttpRequest containes the URL (or GET) parameters, the environment
variables and cookies. If the content type is x-www-url-encoded or multipart/formdata, then the
contents are extracted and available as POST parameters and files. Otherwise the content is
avaiable in raw form for the program to access.

HttpResponse contains methods to set the response headers and a property "entity" of type
ByteArray for the output body. Your code would "write" its output to HttpResponse.entity.
You then call HttpResponse.copy to send the response to an output range.

Two common ways to generate the output content is to use pagebuilder to create a HTML
Document and use jaypha.spinna.pagebuilder.document.transfer, and to create a JSON
structure and use jaypha.spinna.json.transfer.
