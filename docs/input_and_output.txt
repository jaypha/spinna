Web servers take input in the form of a HTTP request and supplies output in the form of an HTTP
response. Spinna works with the request and response directly.

The global variable "request" containes the URL (or GET) parameters, the environment variables and cookies. If the
content is x-www-url-encoded or multipart/.formdata, then the contents are extracted and available
as POST parameters and files. Otherwise the content is avaiable in raw form for the program to
access.

The global variable "response" contains methods to set the reponse headers and the content is
an array of ubytes. The framework generates the HTTP text to be given to the output.

request and response are declared in jaypha.spinna.global as instances of HTTPRequest and
HTTPResponse respectively.
HTTPRequest is defined in jaypha.spinna.request.
HTTPResponse is defined in jaypha.spinna.response.
