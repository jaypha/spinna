The router is the part of the system that determines what service is required based on the url
path given.

In Spinna, the programmer specifies the router via a Fig definition file. This file effectively
defines the website. It is interpereted by the "makerouter" program and D code is created which is
compiled into the website program. The "process_request" rountine acceses the router to identify
the service requested and the function that performs it.

In addition to specifying services, the router definition also defines the roles that are allowed
to access the service. Makerouter extracts this information and constructs a D code lookup table
that "process_request" accesses to determine authorisation.
