<h1>The Router</h1>

<p>The router is the part of the system that determines what action is being
requested based on the URL path and HTTP method given.</p>

<p>In Spinna, the programmer specifies the router via a YAML definition
file.</p>

<p>The router definition effectively defines the website. It is interpereted
by the "makerouter" program and D code is created which is compiled into the
website program.</p>

<p><a href='reference/jaypha.spinna.process.html#RequestProcess'>
<span class='code'>RequestProcessor</span></a> calls the generated router code
to identify the service requested and the function that performs it.</p>

<p>The use of Spinna's router is actually optional. You can use an alternative router by
setting RequestProcess.findRoute to your own router.</p>

<h2>Spinna Router Definition and Usage</h2>

<p>A website application is made up of a number of actions. Each
action is identified by the path section of the URL. In Spinna, these
actions are defined in a router definition file.</p>

<p>This file is in YAML format.</p>

<p>The definition contains two top-level definitions.</p>

<ul>
 <li>"preamble" -  Text to be included in the generated source code as a comment. This
     is optional.</li>
 <li>"routes" - The action definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>The definition of a specific action is a follows</p>

<pre class='code p'>
&lt;name>:
  pattern: &lt;url path fragment>
  module: &lt;module name where functions are defined>
  get: &lt;function name for get requests>
  post: &lt;function name for post requests>
  delete: &lt;function name for delete requests>
  put: &lt;function name for put requests>
  service: &lt;function name for misc requests (default)>
  docroot: &lt;file path>
  serveFiles: &lt;regexp>
  format: &lt;object>
</pre>

<p>The router tries to match each pattern in order of definition. If it matches, the
CURRENT_ACTION environment variable is set to the action name. The framework calls
the function identified by definition for the request method.</p>

<p>If no patterns match the routing fails.</p>

<h3>Recursive definitions.</h3>

<p>A definition can contain sub-routes, by providing a "prefix" field. This forms a path
heirarchy. The router will attempt match the URL path with the pattern prepended with
all the prefixes defined in the heirarchy. The current action is the object names
joined with ".".</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class='code p'>
admin:
  prefix: /admin

  home:
    pattern: /home
    module: mysite.home
    get: getHome
    post: postHome

  search:
    pattern: /search
    module: mysite.search
    service: doSearch
</pre>

<p>This defines several actions. "admin.home.get" will match against "/admin/home"
for GET requests and result in mysite.home.getHome being called. "admin.home.post"
will match against "/admin/home" for POST requests, and mysite.home.postHome
will be called. The action "admin.search" matches against "/admin/search" for all
methods and will result in mysite.search.doSearch being called.</p>

<p>Prefixes are concatentated when performing matches. For example</p>

<pre class='code'>
account:
  prefix: /account

  staff:
    prefix: /staff

    edit:
      pattern: /edit
      module: mysite.edit
      get: doEdit
</pre>

<p>This matches the URL path of "/account/staff/edit" to mysite.edit.doEdit for GET
requests. The current action is account.staff.edit.get.</p>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<p>If a field is ommitted it inherits it's parent. Any provided field will
override any parent filed of the same name except for "prefix".</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre class='code p'>
admin:
  prefix: /admin
  module: mysite.home

  home:
    pattern: /home
    get: getHome
    post: postHome

  search:
    pattern: /search
    module: mysite.search
    service: doSearch
</pre>

<p>admin.home uses module mysite.home, and admin.search uses mysite.search.</p>


<h3>Regular expression patterns</h3>

<p>Patterns can have regular expression components. The content of the regular
expression is extracted and passed to the service in an associative array using the
component names as indexes.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre class='code p'>
  product:
    pattern: "/$name-$number"
    service: getProduct
    format: 
      name: "[a-zA-Z]+"
      number: "[0-9]+"
</pre>

<p>The '$' indicates a regular expression (unless preceeded by a '\'). The format object
define the regular expressions. The above mentiond pattern will match "/john-12" and
"/ball-3" etc. getProduct will be called with an associative array with "name" and "number"
set to the extracted contents.</p>

<p>For example, with the above definition, "/john-12" will result in calling</p>

<p class='code'>getProduct(["name" : "john", "number" : "12" ])</p>


<h3>File Streaming</h3>

<p>The router can be directed to stream files that match the regular expression given.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre class='code p'>
prefix: /images

  files:
    docroot: /path-to-dir
    serveFiles: "/.*\.gif"
</pre>

<p>For path "/images/bottle.gif", The file /path-to-dir/bottle.gif will be streamed. If
the path does not match or the file does not exist, then the router will move on to the
next path.</p>

<h3>Synopsis for called functions</h3>

<p>The synopsis is "void function()" for oridinary services and "void function(string[string])"
for services with regular expression components.</p>

<h2>Compiling and Integrating</h2>

<p>Spinna comes with a utility called makerouter, which must be compiled and installed when
installing Spinna. Makerouter is called:</p>

<p class='code'>makerouter [-h] [-m&lt;module_name>] &lt;input_file></p>

<p>-h - print help<br/>
-m - name of the module of the generated code. Defaults to "gen.router".
</p>

<p>The generated module is written to the standard output.</p>

<p>You would normally use the Spinna router by importing the module created by
makerouter assigning the findRoute member of
RequestProcessor with the findRoute function defined within.</p>

<h2>Spinna Router Modules</h2>
