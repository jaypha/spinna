<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>The Usual Nuts &amp; Bolts</h4>

<p>Spinna comes with many of the features you would expect from an independant
  framework. Support for reading HTTP requests and writing HTTP responses,
  sessions, templates, validation etc.
  There are two things however, that are absent: databases and
  authorisation.</p>
<p>There are no database features because no aspect of Spinna
  requires one. You use your own favorite database code. I have written a
  <a href='https://github.com/jaypha/dbsql'>set of database classes</a>
  and you are welcome to use them, but it is by no means
  obligatory.</p>
<p>Authorisation can be done in many different ways, and I have not yet come
   across a satisfactory universal solution. So I provide a
   means by which you can supply your own authorisation mechanism, and if I
   come across something that can be used, I will consider including it in a
   future release.</p>
   
<h4>Server Independance</h4>

<p>Spinna is desigend to not tie you down to any particular type of web
   server. By creating an appropriate adaptor, you can use Spinna with any web
   server "front end". Spinna comes with three adaptors. One to allow
   execution from the console, another to interface with FCGI, and one to
   interface with Vibe-d.</p>

<h4>Compile Time Router</h4>

<p>Spinna's makerouter utitlity is used to generate D code that is compiled into the
   project to perform the routing tasks. Thus the router is direct binary which would
   be faster than run time created objects.</p>

<h4>Pagebuilder</h4>

<p>Pagebuilder is a set of classes to help you to construct HTML pages. While
   not trying to hide HTML from you, it does seek to take
   much of the boilerplate burden away from you.</p>

<p>Pagebuilder makes use of the fact that HTML is heirarchical in nature. So by
   using classes that derive from the <span class='code'>Component</span>
   interface, you can construct a heirarchy of objects, and then have them
   generate the HTML to be sent to output.</p>

<p>Thus you can create classes as reusable components, to encapsulate boilerplate,
   or simply to breakdown a complex page into smaller chunks.</p>

<p>Pagebuilder supplies classes for common components such as paginated
   lists, forms and widgets.</p>

<h4>Templates</h4>
<p>The ability to embed code inside plain text is popular with website
   programming, and Spinna provides its own template engine to do this. Similar
   in functionality to <a href='http://code.dlang.org/packages/embd'>EmbD</a> and <a href='http://code.dlang.org/packages/temple'>Temple</a>,
   Spinna's template engine is more specialised to work with Pagebuilder.</p>
