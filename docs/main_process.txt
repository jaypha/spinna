processRequest() is the main function that handles requests. It performs the following steps

1. Interperet the HTTP request data and put into an HttpRequest structure.
2. Run the router to determine which service to call. Failure results in a 404 response.
3. Test if service is authorised. Generate either a 303 or a 403 if not.
4. Run the service. The service will fill out the HttpResponse object.
5. Catch any exceptions to generate an error page.
6. Output the HTTP response.
