== Authorisation ==

Spinna uses role based authorisation. Accounts are given one or more roles. Each service
may have a number of roles which are allowed to perform it. With each request, the framework
matches the allowed roles for the service with the roles of the user.

A service may have no roles identified, in which it is considered publicly accessible. If
roles are defined, then the user must be logged in and have at least one of the defined
roles assigned to their account. If the user is authorised, the service is performed
normally. If the user is not authorised, then either a redirection to a login page occurs,
or the request is rejected with a 403 response.

Authorisation for services are defined in the router definition resource.
