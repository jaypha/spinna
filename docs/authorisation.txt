== Authorisation ==

Spinna does not specifically define authorisation itself. This allows the developer
the freedom to use their preferred authorisation method.

The main request processor allows for the declaring of a preServieHandler
function that returns a bool. This is where authorisation checks should take
place. If "false" is returned, the the service will not be performed.

The preServiceHandler is expected to generate the appropriate output if authentication
fails.

The router provided by Spinna adds a CURRENT_ACTION value to the request environment that
can be used by authorisation.
